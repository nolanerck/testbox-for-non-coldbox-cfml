tests should be DUMB
void things like for() loops, recurion, manipulating data struucutres, etc.

Even if you have several similar tests
Tempting to write function calls, etc,

Just copy/paste the chunks of tests that are similar
More self documenting
Easier for new dev's to read as a "story" of what's happening

And if the copoy/paste parts are wrong, the test will fail
so it's a non-issue


exmaple URL for runnign 1 test?
